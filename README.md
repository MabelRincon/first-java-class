# Persona Class in Java

This Java project implements a `Persona` class, designed to model the concept of a person.  The class stores information about a person, including their first name, last name, identity document number, and year of birth.

## Description

The `Persona` class encapsulates the following attributes:

*   `firstName`: The first name of the person (String).
*   `lastName`: The last name of the person (String).
*   `idNumber`: The identity document number of the person (String).
*   `birthYear`: The year of birth of the person (int).

## Constructor

The `Persona` class includes a constructor that initializes these attributes when a new `Persona` object is created:
```java
public Persona(String firstName, String lastName, String idNumber, int birthYear) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.idNumber = idNumber;
    this.birthYear = birthYear;
}
```
